    <p>    <h3>1) <u>What is Lorem Ipsum?</u></h3>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <br>specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br> electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised <br>in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum <br>passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus  <br>PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h3>2) <u>Why do we use it?</u></h3>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable <br> content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem <br>Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as <br>opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. <br> Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as <br>their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites <br> still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes <br> by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
